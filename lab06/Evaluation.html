<p>The engagement is minor since you don't really need to do much more then scroll or click on the links. It is pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic.</p>
<h3>Make at least one recommendation to improve this website based on what you learned in this module.</h3>
<p>I would recommend that there should be a video for each section and not just the risk of rain 2 trailer. anything else that would make it seem like less than a buy. Something like popular risk of rain content creators would be nice.</p>
