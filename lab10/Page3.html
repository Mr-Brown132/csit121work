        <h1>How is HTML Media Capture used?</h1>
        <p>
            HTML Media Capture is used to capture user media, such as audio and video.
            For example, lets say you are using zoom or teams on your web browser and you want to show your face though your webcam.
            HTML Media Capture is used to capture your face and show it on the screen, same goes for your audio.
            HTML Media Capture is useful for web developers to capture user media, such as audio and video, from the user's device and use it in their web pages.
            This can also include a form with a file input field, where the user can upload a video or audio file.
        </p>
        <div class="example1">
            <img src="example1.png" alt="example1">
        </div>
        <p>
            Html media capture is used to record audio and video.
            Such as when i have to record videos for former school projects.
            This is used in apps like siri and cortana which use your voice to complete commands.
            This can be used for learning information on the internet.
        </p>
        <div class="example2">
            <img src="example2.png" alt="example2">
        </div>
        <p>
            Html Media capture can be used for human interactivity.
            It allows for people from across the world to communicate with each other in real time.
            Like grandparents talking to their grandkids through video calls.
            This can be great for those who don't have the time or money to see others.
