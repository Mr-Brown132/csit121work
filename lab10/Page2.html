        <h1>Why is HTML Media Capture important?</h1>
    <p>
            Html media capture is important because it can be used in creative ways to make websites more enteractive and engaging.
        With out HTML Media Capture you couldn't do most things with your webcam on html websites. 
        For example Does that job want you to send a picture of yourself. 
        welp its looks like you would have to email it instead or go in person.
        Or they could have you upload a picture of yourself to the website using a form with a file input field.
    </p>
    <p>
        The improtance of HTML Media Capture can not be understated. 
        The benifit of HTML Media Capture is that it can allow users to capture audio and video information without needing to download other software.
        This can be good for weakers computers where running other software can be a problem.
        There is a friend of my who can't running several programs at the same time because there computer will lag or crash.
        This can make Html Media Capture very useful for them.

    <p>
        With out HTML Media Capture we would lose several important features for Html websites.
        Such as we wouldn't have the ablility to use real-time communicatetion such as vidoe calls, or audio chat.
        We as users would also lose the convenience that HTML Media Capture gives us.
        This would also make websites less accessible.
        On top of that without HTML Media Capture coding a website that needs real-time media would become more difficult to create.
